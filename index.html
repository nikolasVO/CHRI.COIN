            <h2>About Us</h2>
            <p>
                We are a team of young enthusiasts who decided that the world of cryptocurrencies is way too serious and needs a bit more chaos, fun, and memes. Inspired by the spirit of the internet and our love for absurd humor, we created <strong>Meme Coin</strong>—a token that’s not just numbers on a screen, but a true cultural phenomenon.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our story began with a simple idea: what if we combined the power of blockchain with the power of memes? We believe that memes are not just pictures of cats with funny captions. They are the language of a new generation, a way to bring people together, express emotions, and even change the world. And we decided to give this language its own currency.
            </p>
            <h3>Why Meme Coin?</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>It’s fun</strong>: We don’t want to be just another boring token. We want every transaction to bring a smile.</li>
                <li><strong>It’s for everyone</strong>: It doesn’t matter if you’re a crypto expert or a complete newbie. If you understand memes, you’re already part of our community.</li>
                <li><strong>It’s the future</strong>: We believe that memes are the future. And we want to be at the forefront of this revolution.</li>
            </ul>
